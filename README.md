# Huffman compression

### Implementation of the Huffman algorithm in Java (IntelliJ).

- Stores the compressed file with a made up ".u21" extension, with the following inner structure:
```
<'huf' prefix> <filename length> <filename> <encoded message (raw bytes)> <symbols table>
```

The huffman symbols table is a map that holds key-value pairs like so:
```
'a' --> '001'  ;  'b' --> '1011'

Where 'a' and 'b' are symbols obtained from the input text and '001' and '1011' are the codes generated by the huffman tree.
```

The symbols table has its own inner structure:
```
<symbols count>  <char (16-bit each) symbols ...> <codes lengths (for each of the symbol's code)...> <raw bytes of all codes>

i.e. if the symbols table is "'a' --> '001'  ;  'b' --> '1011'", then the serialization would be:
   <2> <'a', 'b'> <3, 4> <0011011> (adding padding bits)
```


**Note:** This implementation is far from perfect or optimized, and it can't compress binary files, only plain text files.
It can however compress large text based files +6MB in a reasonable time at a 0.6 compression rate.
